## 11/4/2025 - Started The Schematic: Power  

I started this project with the idea that I wanted to build my own custom NAS. This is due to the fact that NAS's cost upwards of $700cad not including drives, and thats a lot of money to spend on a 4 slot NAS. I started with a lot of research, I was originally going to use an x86 SOC since thats what TrueNAS is meant for, but since it would be impossible in my time frame to make an x86 board, I decided to go with ARM since it's been recently supported by TrueNAS. After some more research, I decided upon the Raspberry Pi CM5 SOC. It's very basic; only has RAM, WiFi, and the CPU, so I could build everything around it.

To start the schematic, I knew I needed a lot of power due to TrueNAS being power intensive. I decided to learn usb PD. I designed my power rails to handle up to 100W's which should be more than enough. After that, I looked for a PCIe -> SATA controller. I settled on the 88SE9125C0-NAA which should work very well, but only supports 2 SATA drives. I will probably use an IC to convert it to 5, but thats a later me problem.
